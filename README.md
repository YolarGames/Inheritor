**! The project is currently in development !**

**Interesting Features:**
* All scenes in the project could be launched and tested without going through all game flow (main menu, game and so on)
* Scene loading is handled by a semi-custom Scene Manager, which allows me to load scenes by type and not by name (string)
* The Custom Scene Manager also handles scene dependencies.
* Scene Manager can solve circular dependencies

**Programming patterns:**
* StateMachine
* Factory
* ServiceLocator
* Object pooling
* Singleton
* Composition

**Optimization features:**
* Factories
* UI Toolkit with optimized transform translations
* Object pooling
* A few MonoBehaviours
